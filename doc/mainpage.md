The CalcMySky project consists of three parts:
 1. `CalcMySky`, a console utility that computes scattering of light by atmosphere described in a text file, and saves the resulting model;
 2. `libShowMySky`, a library that provides rendering capabilities to applications;
 3. `ShowMySky`, a GUI application that uses `libShowMySky` to let one preview the model generated by `CalcMySky`.
