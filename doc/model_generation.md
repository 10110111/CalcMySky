## Generating the model

The model is generated by `calcmysky` utility from a text file, whose name normally has `.atmo` suffix. The command
```
calcmysky description.atmo --out-dir output-directory
```
will use the input file `description.atmo` and output the model to a directory named `output-directory`.

This utility has some options that can be listed by running it with `--help` option.

### Format of model description file

Model description files consist of entries that represent key-value pairs. Empty lines between entries are ignored, and "#" character starts comments. Single-line entries can also be followed by a comment in the same line.

Any text on a line before the first colon character ":" is considered to be key. Depending on the key, corresponding value can be one of the following:
 * a integral value, e.g. "123";
 * a fractional value, e.g. "123.8767";
 * a dimensionful quantity, e.g. "33.2 km";
 * a list of numbers, e.g. "1.23,6.3245,-7.948,5";
 * a range of wavelengths, e.g. "min=360nm,max=830nm,count=16"
 * a section.

A section begins on the next line after the key, the colon character remains on the line with the key.

Top-level sections are bounded by an opening brace "{" and a closing brace "}". Nested section, which normally are code snippets, are bounded by triple backticks "```", similarly to fenced code blocks in Markdown.

Most key names are self-descriptive, with a few exceptions due to abbreviations:
 * VZA means view zenith angle, i.e. zenith angle of camera direction. Example key is "transmittance texture size for VZA".
 * SZA means sun zenith angle. Example key is "irradiance texture size for SZA".
 * dot(view,sun) is dot product between VZA and SZA.

The `examples` directory in the source tree has a few `*.atmo` files serving as examples.
